# bi-PINN
In the rapidly evolving field of scientific machine learning, physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) haveemerged as a powerful paradigm for numerically solving partial differential equations (PDEs). Within thisframework, boundary conditions serve as essential physical prior knowledge. However, the approximateenforcement of these conditions often emerges as a critical accuracy bottleneck, particularly near the domainboundaries. To address this challenge, we propose a boundary-information-enhanced physics-informed neuralnetwork (bi-PINN), which systematically strengthens the impact of boundary physics on the training process.The core innovation lies in a soft boundary-derivative restraint (bd-restraint) that incorporates higher-orderor tangential derivative information—derived from the underlying physical laws or the differential-geometricproperties of the boundary manifold—directly into the loss function. Since these derivative relationships aretypically not explicit in the raw boundary data, the bd-restraint is generated offline via symbolic or automaticdifferentiation of the governing equations and the geometric description. We validate the effectiveness ofthe bi-PINN through various benchmark problems that span diverse physical regimes: the Poisson equation,linear elasticity, heat conduction problem, and the Korteweg–de Vries (KdV) equation. Extensive numericalcomparisons demonstrate that the bi-PINN achieves a one to two-order of magnitude reduction in boundaryerror and consistently improves accuracy across the entire computational domain compared to conventionalPINNs. These results underscore the potential of bi-PINN for high-fidelity simulations of complex and freeboundaryproblems, especially when only partial physical knowledge is available. These results underscorethe computational efficiency and potential of bi-PINN in tackling real-world and complex problems.
